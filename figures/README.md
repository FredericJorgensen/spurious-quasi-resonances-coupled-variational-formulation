## Explanation of Naming Conventions for Figures

### getSingularValueOfBlock
If the first part of the name is *getSingularValueOfBlock*:  the value plotted is one of the the singular values 
(which is denoted by *index*) of the matrix block *n*. 
Here *n* is defined after *n_* and *index* is defined after *index_*.

### getMinimumSingularValue / getMaximumSingularValue
If the first part of the name is *getMinimumSingularValue / getMaximumSingularValue*: The value plotted is the minimum / maximum singular value of the block matrices with n in [-N, N].
Here *N* is defined after *N_*.

### Other
The number after *c_i_* correspond to the optical index used.
